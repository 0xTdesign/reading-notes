Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

A Syntax error is normally a spelling mistake in the code. The error will show which line it is making it easier to locate and correct. The logic error is a bit harder to fix since it does not give an error. This is becuase the code will work but not how you wanted it to. This then makes it hardeer sicne you have to look through all your code to try and fix.



List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

Over the last month or so I have had a fair few errors. Mostly are Syntax errors from spelling mistake to missing the bracket. These are easy to fix. The harder ones are the Logic areas which takes me some time to find out the issue. But by using Console log to help this speeds up the process.



How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

It allows me to understand what the errors are and how best to go about to fix them. Once u understand what your're looking for then it makes it a lot faster to fix them.



How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

Javascript Debugger allows you to try and pin point the issue in your code by running snippets of it to try and find the issue. Allows you to run through it bit by bit. 

Define what a breakpoint is.


What is the call stack?

Call stack shows you what code was executed to get the current line. It keeps track of its place in a script thats calls multiple functions.
