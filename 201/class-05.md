What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

  The ``` <img src="cat.jpg" alt="cat">``` is used so that you can give a descirtion of what the images is if for some reason they can not see it. 



How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

- Using the headings correctly 
- Include proper alt text for images 
- Using good colours on your websites
- The layout of your website
- Making sure your links are named correctly 


There are a few things that you can do to make the images 

- Using Alternative text 
- Having descriptions in the HTML 
- If the images are mostly decorative provide at least a null ```(alt="")
- Avoid text in the images 

Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

A figure element would be good say if you had lots of images like 20 you can put them all in a ```<figure>``` and have them in a container and to link the figure to the caption. This would be good for a magazine type website so you can have the captions under all the images and this would help with screen readers.


Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

The difference between gif and SVG is that a Gif i low res and will look pixelated and not good for scaling up. As for a SVG it can be scalable and the resolution is independtent give you way more detail and will look clear on your screen. 


What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

I would use a Jpeg to display a screenshot on my website. The reason is becasue of the size of the file is smaller than using a png.
