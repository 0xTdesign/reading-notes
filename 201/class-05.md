What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?

  The ``` <img src="cat.jpg" alt="cat">``` is used so that you can give a descirtion of what the images is if for some reason they can not see it. 



How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?

- Using the headings correctly 
- Include proper alt text for images 
- Using good colours on your websites
- The layout of your website
- Making sure your links are named correctly 


There are a few things that you can do to make the images 

- Using Alternative text 
- Having descriptions in the HTML 
- If the images are mostly decorative provide at least a null ```(alt="")
- Avoid text in the images 

Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.

A figure element would be good say if you had lots of images like 20 you can put them all in a ```<figure>``` and have them in a container and to link the figure to the caption. This would be good for a magazine type website so you can have the captions under all the images and this would help with screen readers.


Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.

The difference between gif and SVG is that a Gif i low res and will look pixelated and not good for scaling up. As for a SVG it can be scalable and the resolution is independtent give you way more detail and will look clear on your screen. 


What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?

I would use a Jpeg to display a screenshot on my website. The reason is becasue of the size of the file is smaller than using a png. 



Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.

Foreground colours defines the property of the contents element. So say if you had a painting and you picked your colour, Any brush marks that you did would be the foreground colour. And what you painted on was the background colours you dont want you foreground colours being the same colours as your background range. You want a clean background that will show your whole painting with foreground colours over the top.


Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?

I would first look at his blog and see what stands out. I would look for key elements such as an image/logo and use a Hex colour picker to then take around 3 colours and incorporate them into his design. I feel that using a more simple colour palette in todays designs are more eye catching. Sometimes having to much colour is distracting and takes you away from all the content.


What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?

When choosing fonts you want to first look at your project and see what font will fit the design. Say if you had a old style game design you would look for a fomt that was a bit retro. This type of font would work. But it would not work for say a news paper website. I will list a few things to consider while choosing fonts.

- readability 
- Project style 
- What type of message are you trying to make stand out 
- What type of mood are you trying to set
- What language will your website be. Some languages are hard to read in certain fonts
- Does the brand have certain look that needs to follow. 
- Size of fonts 


What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements?

Font-size will allow you to change the size of the font. 

``` font-size:1rem;``` This Css style would change the font to 1rem or 16pxs 

Font-stlye allows the user to change the font to either italic,normal or oblique. 

``` font-style:italic;``` This style when applied to content would change the font to italic. 

Font-weight allows the user to change the boldness of the font. You can either have thick lined font or skinny. This is good for making headings or content stand out on the page.

``` font-weight:bold;``` This style would make the font Bold. You can also use numbers from 100 to 900 to fine tune your font thickness. 

Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element.

You can use letter-spacing and word-spacing. By using these to you can put space between the letter of the h1 element. Below is a simple example.
