# Why does this subject matter? 

HTML,CSS, and Javascript are the key components that all work together that help us create the final outcome of a project. Understanding all 3 and how they work together can help the developer not only create the project but also bring more of an interactive side to the website to it. 

## Why is it important to use semantic elements in our HTML?


### How many levels of headings are there in HTML?

There are 6 levels of Headings in HTML.


### What are some uses for the <sup> and <sub> elements?

 A sub tag could be used for things like chemical formulas and a Sup tag can be used for footer notes.
   
### When using the <abbr> element, what attribute must be added to provide the full expansion of the term?

### When using the <abbr> element you would need to use the Title attribute this must contain the full readable description of the abbr tag.
  
#### What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

  The most common and best way I think to apply CSS to HTML is by linking the style sheet to the html document. This can be done by adding a link to the head of the HTML page.
  ```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
  
  ```
  Or another way you can do it is to add CSS. to the HTML document. You will have to add a <Style> tag inside the <head> and then you can write CSS. But this way starts to make your code harder to read since everything is together.
  
#### Why should we avoid using inline styles?
  
This is not the best practice and makes your code hard to read. You will also need multiple edits on some areas. It makes everything harder to read and is not the best practice.
  
  
  
#### Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
  
  ```
     h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }
  
  ```
#### What is representing the selector?

  The above code represents an h2 tag that and it is being targeted in CSS to change the color of the text to black and then give it some spacing with padding.
  
  
#### Which components are the CSS declarations?

  Color and padding are the components in CSS for this code.
  
  
#### Which components are considered properties?

  The components are what you want to change or happen. So in this case it would be Color and Padding. These are the components that you're targeting to change.
  

  
 What data type is a sequence of text enclosed in single quote marks?
  
  A string is a sequence of text that is enclosed in single quote marks
  
  
List 4 types of JavaScript operators.
  
  ```
  + This adds numbers together or combines them
  
  = This assigns the value to a given name
  
  === This does a test to see if the two values are equal
  
  * This can be used to multiply 
  
  ```
  
  
#### Describe a real-world Problem you could solve with a Function.
  
 You could use a function for a vending machine. The user puts in money and then selects a drink. You could set up a function that then is triggered when the money goes in and the user selects one of the options on the machine.
  
  
  
 An if statement checks a __ and if it evaluates to ___, then the code block will execute.
 
 An IF Statement checks a (Condition) and if it evaluates to True then the code will block will execute.
 
What is the use of an else if?
 
The use of an "Else If" is to test a new condition if the ones above are false.
 
 
List 3 different types of comparison operators.

 === This is to check if the value is lee or greater than each other 
 
 < > This is used to check if one value is less or greater than the other 
 
 <= => This is to check if the value is less or greater than each other. 
 
 
What is the difference between the logical operator && and ||?
  
 The difference between "&&" and "||" is the "&&" will need all to come back "True" for the whole expression to return ```True```and "||" only needs one or more to come back ``` true ``` for the whole expression to come back ```true```

Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
Use switch to select one of many blocks of code to be executed
