#### What are ways we can apply CSS to our HTML?

  The most common and best way I think to apply CSS to HTML is by linking the style sheet to the html document. This can be done by adding a link to the head of the html page.
  ```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css">
  
  ```
  Or another way you can do it is add CSS. to th HTML document. You will have to add a <Style> tag inside the <head> and then you can write CSS. But this way starts to make your code harder to read since eveything is together.
  
#### Why should we avoid using inline styles?
  
This is not the best pratice and makes your code hard to read. You will also need multiple edits on some areas. It makes everything harder to read and is not the best practice.
  
  
  
#### Review the block of code below and answer the following questions:
  
  ```
     h2 {
     color: black;
     padding: 5px;
   }
  
  ```
#### What is representing the selector?

  The above code represents a h2 tag that and its being targeted in CSS to change the color of the text to black and then giving it some spacing with padding.
  
  
#### Which components are the CSS declarations?

  Color and padding are the components in CSS for this code.
  
  
#### Which components are considered properties?

  The components are what you want to change or happen. So in this case it would be Color and Padding. These are the compoents that you're targeting to change.
