# HTTP 

There once was a boy called Jimmy that wanted to go to a Ikea(open browser) 
On his route he had to find the street address(Website) 
He needed a pair of shoes that would help him on his journey(Internet) 
But before he could go he had to place an order to see if they are there so he dont waste is time getting transport there. ( TCP) 
But he will need to also know the language that the shop speaks( HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol )
Once he arrives at the shop he then checks to see if his items are all in the right place.( Html,Css,Javascript)

 - Internet Connection
 - TCP/IP
 - DNS
 - HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol 
 - Component files; 
   - Code Files 
   - Assets 

What happens in steps 

- Browser opens the DNS server
- The Browser sends the HTTP request. Its asked to send a copy of the website from the client. 
- Once the the client sends the ok message then it will start sharing all the packets to the user. 
- The browser will then take the packets of data and will transform them into how the website was built. 


##  HTML, CSS, and JS files

Browsers start by parse the HTML file. It will look for all any <Link> and <script> elements and parase those files. While the broswer is checking all the HTML it will also be sending requests to check the other files that are contained in the HTML just as the CSS and JS files. This allows the browser to geneerate an in-memory CSSom structure from the Css files creeating a DOM tree.

 String ``` Let Name = 'Tim'; ```
 
A string is a sequence of text that is known as a string. You can tell that it is a string by the quote mares aorund the number or text.
