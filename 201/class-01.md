# HTTP 

There once was a boy called Jimmy that wanted to go to a Ikea(open browser) 
On his route he had to find the street address(Website) 
He needed a pair of shoes that would help him on his journey(Internet) 
But before he could go he had to place an order to see if they are there so he dont waste is time getting transport there. ( TCP) 
But he will need to also know the language that the shop speaks( HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol )
Once he arrives at the shop he then checks to see if his items are all in the right place.( Html,Css,Javascript)

 - Internet Connection
 - TCP/IP
 - DNS
 - HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol 
 - Component files; 
   - Code Files 
   - Assets 

What happens in steps 

- Browser opens the DNS server
- The Browser sends the HTTP request. Its asked to send a copy of the website from the client. 
- Once the the client sends the ok message then it will start sharing all the packets to the user. 
- The browser will then take the packets of data and will transform them into how the website was built. 


##  HTML, CSS, and JS files

Browsers start by parse the HTML file. It will look for all any <Link> and <script> elements and parase those files. While the broswer is checking all the HTML it will also be sending requests to check the other files that are contained in the HTML just as the CSS and JS files. This allows the browser to geneerate an in-memory CSSom structure from the Css files creeating a DOM tree. 
 
 
 
 ### How to find images for you webstie? 
 
 There are a few ways that you can add images to your website. But you need to be careful of Copyright. This can easily be done by using the Google license filter. This will help you only look for images that can be used. Once you have found the image that you would like to use for your website you can either copy the image link by right clicking and selecting the Copy Image address. Or another way is to right click and save the image file to your computer Desktop and then dragging the file into your VScode and adding it that way. 


#### String vs a Number in Javascript? 

 String ``` Let Name = 'Tim'; ```
 
A string is a sequence of text that is known as a string. You can tell that it is a string by the quote mares aorund the number or text.
 
 
 Number ``` Let cars = 20; ```
 
 As you can see this is a numner it does not have quotes around it. This shows that it is a number and not a String. If it had quotes around it then it would be a String. 
 
 
 #### What is a Variable? 
 
 A Variable allows you to store something as a value. You're declaring something with a word. Below is an example. 
 
 ```
 let name = Tim;
 
 ```
You can name a variable nearly anything. There are a few names that you cant use which Google will tell you them. 
 
 Variables are really important when using Javascript. They allow us to contain values to which we can later then use in our code. This also keeps our code clean. 
 
 
##### What is an HTML attribute?
 
 All elements can have HTML Attribute. This can be a href, Src or even and Alt for an image if the image does not load it will say the name of the image so people can stil understand what it is.  Below is an example. 
 
 ```
 <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp"> Hello World</a> 
 ```
 
##### What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?

What Elements does a “typical” website include?

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Class-01</title>
</head>
<body>
