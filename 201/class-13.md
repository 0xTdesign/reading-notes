Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?

The main reason is why you use local storage is when you close an application on your desktop and reopen it it will be in its most recent state. Without local storage every time you closed and opened it will reset the state. Local storage helos speed up load times. The first time you load a website it might take a bit of time but the next time you open it will run much faster.

What information should not be stored in local storage?

Local storage should never be used for personal information such as passwords or security keys.

Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?

Local storage can only store String Data for its keys and values. The way you would convert it would be to use JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() methods
