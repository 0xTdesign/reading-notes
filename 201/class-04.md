##### What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

The fixed positioning is with respect to the viewport, Eg the screen you are looking. Say you had a header and set it to fixed. The header would always be there even when you scroll. But if it was absolute the element will be exactly where you positioned it but if you scrolled it would be gone.

Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.


The benefit of pair programming can help in so many ways. By pairing up with another coder you can check through errors and code a lot fast. By having 2 people check the code at the same time. This allows for a faster and more improved quality of code. It will give you fast feedback on your code and gives you greater efficiency. It also trains people faster if they are working on the same project. Two heads are better than one.
