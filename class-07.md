## Control Flow 

Control flow is how the computer excutes the commands. The commands will run through the list of commands starting from the first to the last. 

```


let ducks = prompt("How many ducks you going to Mint ");

let message

if (ducks < 5){
    message = "Little Duckling"
}
else if (ducks > 10) {
    message = "Duck Whale"
}

else {
    message = "Quack Quack "
}

document.write(message);

```
