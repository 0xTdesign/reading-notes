## Control Flow 

Control flow is how the computer excutes the commands. The commands will run through the list of commands starting from the first to the last. 

```


let ducks = prompt("How many ducks you going to Mint ");

let message

if (ducks < 5){
    message = "Little Duckling"
}
else if (ducks > 10) {
    message = "Duck Whale"
}

else {
    message = "Quack Quack "
}

document.write(message);

```

### Function syntax


Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}




#### JavaScript Functions 

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

```
let myFunction() { 
alert ("Hello World")
}

```

##### JavaScript Operators

Operators allows you to assign a value to anything which you can then use to to do arrange of task. Below is an exmaple of how it can be used. 

```
let x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
let y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
let z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)

```

As you can see the above commands have been assigned to a letter which can then be used in a string to add them together.
