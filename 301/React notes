reactDOM.render()

Wrap more elements with Div or tag

Import React from “react”

Import ReactDOM from ‘react-dom”

ReactDOM.render(VARIABLE HERE, document.getElementById("root"))







1. Why do we need to `import React from "react"` in our files?

React is what defines JSX 

2. If I were to console.log(page) in index.js, what would show up?

You would see a Javascript object

3. What's wrong with this code:

It does not have a parent like a Div wrapping them. Needs to have a single parent.
```
const page = (
    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>This is my website!</p>
)
```


4. What does it mean for something to be "declarative" instead of "imperative"?

Imperative: Have to give Step by step on how to do everything.
Declarative: Means you can tell the computer what to do and it will handle the details

5. What does it mean for something to be "composable"?

We have small pieces we can put together to make something larger or greater.
