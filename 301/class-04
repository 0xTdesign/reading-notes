## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

Controlld components are those in which forms data is handled by the components state. It takes it current value through props and changes through callbacks onClick.


## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

When the user enters or changes the state the components will re-render. Meaning the output will change according to the new values.

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

You can add a Name attribute such as ``` event.target.name```



## Why would we use a ternary operator?

This allows us to write code on one line. By using the ? it will check if its True and if not then its fals.

## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

```
if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

```

```
let x = true

x = true ?: false 
console.log(x)


```
