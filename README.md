# Tim Growth Mindset

## Hi My name is Tim, 

<P>Hi, my name is Tim. Follow me on my journey as i turn my life upside down, leaving everything i know behind to follow my passion, coding. Look around and enjoy and contact me if you like..</p>

### Below is a list of what I think are the best growth mindsets.

'''
 - The act of thinking about the problem means your already half way there. 
 - Never think that you can't do something. 
 - Time and patience is all you need.
 - If you dont try you will never get anywhere
 - Without a challange life would be boring.

#### Growth mindset 

There is more to life than just doing the same thing over and over. Learning is the key to expand your mind. If you put your mind to it you will succeed. Failure is not an option. At the end of the day you get what you put in.
